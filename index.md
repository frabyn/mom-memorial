Debra Ann Perdue passed away peacefully on June 22, 2022, at home surrounded by her family. The cause was breast cancer. She was 64.

Debbie was born in Anaheim, California on January 15, 1958, to Paul Allen Perdue and Gertha Lee Morris Perdue, the second of three children. The Perdue family eventually settled in Houston. Debbie graduated from North Shore High School in 1976.

Soon afterward, she met Gordon Newton Bynum, a lawyer and recovering music producer living in the Montrose neighborhood. Debbie loved city life and shared many trips and adventures with Gordon. They married in 1981 and had two children: Franklin Gordon Bynum, born in 1982; and Samuel Newton Bynum, born in 1985. After divorcing Gordon in 1988, Debbie married Patrick Shannon McCary on Valentine's Day, 1993. Her youngest son, Matthew Taylor McCary, was born in 1994.

Debbie brought an endless energy to every part of her life. She was a strong, hardworking, independent mother to her brilliant children. She relished being the "cool mom." She always was.

She built a successful career working in business administration and commercial real estate management, but wouldn't be satisfied until she fulfilled her lifelong dream of becoming a teacher. She began a second career and took to the work right away: she had finally found her calling, as an elementary school teacher.

She loved her students. She would work day and night helping them with schoolwork and counseling them through the diffuclty of growing up. She would corral supplies and pay from her own pocket for the needs of her classroom and children.

In 2019, the Houston Chronicle featured her outstanding classroom work in an article. She said her students "face so many circumstances that we don't know everything about" and so "when they come in, I tell them, we're here, we're going to learn things, and we're going to have fun, we're a family and we're safe." She brought her whole spirit to the classroom every day. "We are going to cheer when they're winning and we're going to cry with them when they're not."

She received a Master's in Arts in Teaching from the College of Public Service at the University of Houston Downtown in 2020.

She is survived by her siblings, Paula Gann of Kilgore, Texas and Michael Perdue of Cleveland, Texas; by her three sons, Matthew, Samuel, and Franklin, currently the judge of Harris County Criminal Court at Law # 8; and by one grandchild, Marguerite Maureen Bynum. She loves them all to the moon and back.

The memorial service is on Thursday, June 30 at 7 p.m. at The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints at 1101 Bering Drive in Houston.
